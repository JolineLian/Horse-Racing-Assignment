               Rating 
               91-100 = + 5
               81-90 = + 4
               71-80 = + 3
               61-70 = + 2
               51-60 = + 1
               < 50 = + 0
               
               Preferred length == race length + 6
               Preferred length - 1 == race length || preferred length + 1 == race length + 4
               Preferred length - 2 == race length || preferred length + 2 == race length + 2
               Preferred length - 3 > race length || preferred length + 3 < race length + 0
               
               FOR PLACE (wins money if horse is 1st (less than win) or 2nd (more than win))
  
               
               
               
               FOR SHOW (wins money if horse is 1st (less than show 2nd), 2nd (less than show 3rd), or 3rd (less than place 2nd))
               
               FOR BOXING (the horses you bet can place in any order)
               e.x. boxing and exacta means either horse could place 1st or 2nd
               - cost (exacta): 2 combinations so $4 (each combination is $2)
               
               FOR EXACTA (wins money if better selects correct finishing order of 1st and 2nd)
               e.x. $2 exacta (2-4) bet on horse #2 to finish 1st and horse #4 to finish 2nd
               betting into a pool with no fixed odds, money is distributed among winning tickets
               - generate players randomly during the race (betting pool will increase)
               - divide by number of WINNING players
